"""Per-layer sub-graph splitting for Phase B (isolated-input strategy).

Instead of one giant part-graph with all taps bolted on (which overflows the
2 GB output buffer and requires fragile whole-graph surgery), we cut each part
into ONE SUB-GRAPH PER DECODER LAYER using the production split machinery
(``split_onnx_by_names`` at residual boundaries). Each sub-graph:

  * takes the previous layer's residual as an INPUT (auto-wired by the splitter)
    plus the shared attention_mask / position_ids and this layer's KV inputs;
  * outputs this layer's residual + its o_proj / gate_up / down taps + KV out.

Because every sub-graph is fed golden inputs at its boundary, its SQNR is that
layer's own transfer function (isolated, immune to upstream accumulation), and a
compile/runtime failure localizes to a single layer. Each job's output is a
handful of small tensors -> no size limit, and the splitter subsets encodings
per sub-graph, so no manual encoding/value_info surgery.
