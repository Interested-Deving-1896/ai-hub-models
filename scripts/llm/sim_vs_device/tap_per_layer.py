"""Tap per-layer outputs -- fine sim-vs-device localization via per-layer split.

(The driver labels this "Phase B".) Given a Part to instrument, split it into
one sub-graph PER DECODER LAYER using the production split utility (cut at
residual-add boundaries), then for each layer sub-graph tap its projection
outputs (o_proj, gate/up, down) and residual. Each sub-graph is fed the GOLDEN
previous-layer residual + shared mask/pos + this layer's KV (isolated inputs),
compiled and run independently, and SQNR is computed at each tap. Because every
job outputs only one layer's small tensors, this avoids the output-size limits
of tapping a whole Part at once, and a failure localizes to a single layer.

Tap selection rule (keeps encodings untouched): only tensors that ALREADY carry
an INT activation encoding are tapped -- the compile path uses --quantize_io
(all graph I/O quantized), so an un-encoded (or floated) new output would break
compilation. Since encodings are keyed by tensor name and independent of
graph-output status, promoting an already-quantized tensor to an output needs
zero encoding edits.

The interval between consecutive taps that craters (down/residual vs o_proj/
gate_up) names the culprit region within the layer.
