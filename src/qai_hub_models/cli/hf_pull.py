"""Download a published recipe from HuggingFace.

Called by the lean CLI's ``register`` when its target looks like an HF repo
id rather than a local folder. Lives heavy-side because ``huggingface_hub``
is a ``qai_hub_models`` dependency and not a lean-CLI one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo_id
        HuggingFace repo id, e.g. ``ashwmurt/yolov8_pose``.
    dest
        Local directory to download into. Created if absent.
    revision
        Branch, tag, or commit to download. Defaults to the repo's default.
    token
        HuggingFace token. Falls back to ``HF_TOKEN`` / the login cache.
