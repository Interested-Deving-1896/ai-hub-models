"""Guard the release wheel's package include/exclude lists, and what cites them.

Two failure modes, both silent until a user hits them on PyPI.

A published recipe whose source is dropped from the wheel still ships its
metadata (setuptools keeps files of excluded sub-packages as data files of an
ancestor package). The resulting metadata-only folder imports as an implicit
namespace package, so failures surface far downstream as a bare
``AttributeError: module '...' has no attribute 'Model'``.

Separately, shipped code may *name* an excluded package. ``configure_dataset``
lived in ``qai_hub_models/scripts/``, and fourteen shipped dataset modules told
users to run it, so a PyPI user who followed the printed instruction got
``No module named qai_hub_models.scripts``. The reference was inside a string,
so no import ever failed and nothing caught it.
